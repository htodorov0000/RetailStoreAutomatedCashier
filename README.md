# RetailStoreAutomatedCashier

The program presented for this assignment is an automated retail store cashier. This software is a command-line interface designed to be used for hours during which staff may not be present at a retail store. Customers may use the interface to add products from a list to their cart. Afterwards, the customer may pay in cash, and the machine will return change. Finally, a mobile robot inside the building can collect the requested products, and return them to be dispensed for the customer.
